The TOPtesi bundle contains everything is needed for typesetting a
bachelor, master or PhD thesis in Italian (or in any other language
supported by LaTeX: the bundle supports multi-language use).

The infix strings may be selected and specified at will by means
of a configuration file, so as to customise the information of the
front page to the requirements of a specific university and a specific
language.

Thanks to its language management, the bundle is suited for
multi-language theses that are more and more frequent thanks
to the double degree programs of the European Union Erasmus programs
or the Life Long Learning European programs.

Warning: The PDF examples attached to this bundle contain some fake university 
logos; the real logos are not distributed with this bundle since they are a 
property of the specific universities. You can download them directly from 
the university sites, or you may change the logo file names with those of 
other institutions, in particular that of your own university; or you may 
substitute them with picture file names of your choice, since they are just 
examples of usage and they have no particular meaning in the sample files.
Remember: you can edit the sample/template files the way you want, provided 
you change their names.
